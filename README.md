# TicTacToe with classical Q-learning

## Some instructions

- Train.ipynb can be used to train a Q-table
- The implementation relies on random initialization. In my experiments the result wasn't always optimal when using current timestamp as random seed
- The random seed is set in the Agent class
- Play-TicTacToe-from-saved-Q-table.py can be used to play the game with a saved Q-table
